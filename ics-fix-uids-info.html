<h1>Super ICS Adjusting Python Hocus-Pocus</h1>
<p><em>Well you see this work-around is something quite atrocious&hellip;</em></p>
<h2>How to avoid duplicate events when syncing your 9W schedule</h2>
<p>Firstly, if you just want the schedule on your phone, the <a href="https://twitter.com/London_Geekfest/status/1023293077514084354">official mobile apps</a> will do that without anything like this. But if you do want to sync your events into e.g. Google Calendar and are already familiar with ICS export/import&hellip;</h2>
<p>You may have noticed that Grenadine has an ICS export feature. The problem is, if you use it <strong>more than once</strong>, you get duplicate events. This is because it seems to generate the event UIDs randomly during each export, so the receiving calendar thinks each event is new every time.</p>
<p>So I made this horrible work-around, which you can pass your ICS file through, to try and make the IDs consistent. It's a few extra steps but it means that repeated export/import should no longer cause duplicates.</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>No warranty, express or implied.</strong> Don't blame me if this eats your calendar or causes other Bad Stuff.</li>
<li><strong>If an event title or start time is changed, you'll still get a duplicate</strong>, because I generate the UID from those things.</li>
<li><strong>If you un-tick an event (or it gets cancelled?), this process won't remove it,</strong> because the exporter that you're starting from doesn't generate a <tt>STATUS:CANCELLED</tt> version of it, it just leaves it out.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Let's do this!</h2>
<p>First, if you already imported your schedule directly, delete those events from the receiving calendar. (This script can only de-duplicate against repeated runs of itself, not against previous random UIDs.)</p>
<p>Next, get your ICS file, e.g. from the Nine Worlds <a href="https://sites.grenadine.co/sites/nineworlds/en/2018/my-account#schedule">My Schedule</a> page. The button says "Download these events to your calendar". Then submit that file below and I'll give you a version with more stable UIDs, which you can then import into your calendar. Repeat this process after you discover more sessions, and enjoy fewer duplicates. :-)</p>
